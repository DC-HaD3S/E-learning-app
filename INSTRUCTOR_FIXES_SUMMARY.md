# Instructor Login and UI Fixes - Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Authentication Service Issues
**Problem**: The frontend `AuthService` only recognized `ADMIN` and `USER` roles, not `INSTRUCTOR`.

**Solution**:
- Updated `AuthService` to properly handle `INSTRUCTOR` role
- Added `isInstructor()` method
- Added `getUserRole()` method that returns proper `UserRole` enum
- Added `getInstructorId()` method to retrieve instructor application ID
- Updated `initializeApp()` and `login()` methods to handle instructor role

### 2. JWT Token Enhancement
**Problem**: JWT tokens didn't include instructor ID, making it difficult to identify instructor's data.

**Solution**:
- Modified `JwtService.java` to include `instructorId` and `userId` in tokens
- For instructors, the token now includes their instructor application ID
- Added automatic instructor ID lookup during token generation

### 3. Auth Interceptor Updates
**Problem**: Instructor-specific endpoints were not included in protected routes.

**Solution**:
- Updated `auth.interceptor.ts` to include instructor endpoints:
  - `/instructor/apply`
  - `/instructor/applications`
  - `/instructor/approve`
  - `/instructor/average-rating`
  - All instructor PUT/POST/DELETE operations

### 4. Instructor Service Fixes
**Problem**: Service methods didn't match backend endpoints.

**Solution**:
- Updated `InstructorService` to use correct backend endpoints:
  - `getInstructorApplications()` → `/instructor/applications`
  - `submitApplication()` → `/instructor/apply`
  - `approveApplication()` → `/instructor/approve`
  - Added `getInstructorById()` → `/instructor/{id}`
  - Added `updateInstructorDetails()` → `/instructor`
  - Added instructor statistics methods

### 5. Instructor Profile Component
**Problem**: Component tried to fetch instructor by name instead of ID.

**Solution**:
- Updated `InstructorProfileComponent` to use instructor ID
- Load instructor details using `/instructor/{id}` endpoint
- Added parallel loading of instructor data (details, rating, enrollment count, courses)
- Better error handling for missing instructor applications

### 6. Course Management for Instructors
**Problem**: Instructors had no course management functionality.

**Solution**:
- Completely implemented `InstructorCoursesComponent` with full CRUD operations
- Added dedicated `/courses/my-courses` endpoint integration
- Created comprehensive UI with:
  - Course listing grid
  - Add/Edit course modal
  - Delete course confirmation
  - Course content management navigation
  - Responsive design

### 7. Navigation Updates
**Problem**: Instructor navbar didn't have course management links.

**Solution**:
- Added "Manage Courses" navigation item for instructors
- Updated navbar component with `goToInstructorCourses()` method
- Added course management button to instructor profile

### 8. Routing Configuration
**Problem**: Instructor routing didn't include courses management.

**Solution**:
- Added `/instructor/courses` route to `InstructorRoutingModule`
- Proper role-based access control with `AuthGuard`

## Backend Endpoint Analysis

### Existing Endpoints Used:
1. **Authentication**:
   - `POST /auth/login` - Login with JWT token generation
   - `POST /auth/signup` - User registration

2. **Instructor Management**:
   - `GET /instructor/applications` - Get all instructor applications (admin)
   - `POST /instructor/apply` - Submit instructor application
   - `POST /instructor/approve` - Approve instructor application (admin)
   - `GET /instructor/{instructorId}` - Get instructor details by ID
   - `PUT /instructor` - Update instructor details
   - `GET /instructor/average-rating` - Get instructor average rating
   - `GET /instructor/{instructorId}/enrollment-count` - Get enrollment count
   - `GET /instructor/{instructorId}/highest-enrolled-courses` - Get top courses

3. **Course Management**:
   - `GET /courses/my-courses` - Get instructor's courses
   - `POST /courses` - Create new course
   - `PUT /courses/{id}` - Update course
   - `DELETE /courses/{id}` - Delete course
   - `GET /courses/{courseId}/topic` - Get course content
   - `POST /courses/{courseId}/topic` - Add course topics

## How to Test

### 1. Create an Instructor Account
1. Register as a normal user
2. Submit instructor application via user dashboard
3. Admin approves the application
4. User role changes to INSTRUCTOR

4. Fill out course form and save
5. Should see course in the grid
6. Test Edit, Delete, and View functionality

### 4. Test Profile Management
1. View instructor profile with statistics
2. Click "Edit Profile" to update details
3. Save changes and verify updates

## Technical Improvements
