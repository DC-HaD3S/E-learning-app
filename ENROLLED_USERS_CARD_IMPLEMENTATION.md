## Overview
I have successfully implemented a card-based view for enrolled users with a "View Details" functionality that opens a Material Dialog showing course enrollment count and detailed information.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. User Details Dialog Component

- **Features**:
  - Beautiful dialog showing user information
  - Prominent display of total enrolled courses count
  - List of all enrolled courses with course IDs
  - Export functionality to download user details as JSON
  - Responsive design with animations
  - Professional styling with gradients and hover effects

### 2. Enhanced Enrolled Users Component

### 4. Technical Implementation

#### Dialog Structure
```typescript
interface EnrolledUser {
  name: string;
  email: string;
  username: string;
  enrolledCourses: { courseId: number; courseName: string }[];
}
```

#### Key Methods
- `openUserDetails(user: EnrolledUser)` - Opens the dialog with user data
- `onExportDetails()` - Exports user details as JSON file

#### Styling Features
- Gradient backgrounds for visual appeal
- Material Design icons throughout
- Hover effects and transitions
- Responsive breakpoints for mobile devices
- Professional color scheme matching the existing design

### 5. User Experience

#### In Cards View
1. User sees enrolled user cards with course count
2. Clicks "View Details" button on any card
3. Dialog opens showing:
   - User profile information
   - Total enrolled courses count (prominently displayed)
   - Complete list of enrolled courses
   - Option to export details

#### In Table View
1. User sees tabular data with all user information
2. Clicks "Details" button in the Actions column
3. Same dialog functionality as cards view

### 6. Benefits
- **Clear Information Display**: Course count is prominently shown
- **Detailed View**: Complete course information in organized format
- **Export Capability**: Users can download enrollment data
- **Consistent Design**: Matches existing application aesthetics
- **Responsive**: Works across all device sizes

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files
- `frontend/src/app/modules/admin/components/enrolled-users/user-details-dialog.component.ts`

### Modified Files
- `frontend/src/app/modules/admin/components/enrolled-users/enrolled-users.component.ts`
- `frontend/src/app/modules/admin/components/enrolled-users/enrolled-users.component.html`
- `frontend/src/app/modules/admin/components/enrolled-users/enrolled-users.component.css`
- `frontend/src/app/modules/admin/admin.module.ts`

## Usage
1. Navigate to the Enrolled Users section in the admin panel
2. Switch between Cards and Table view using the toggle buttons
3. Click "View Details" on any user card or table row
4. The dialog will open showing:
   - User information
   - **Number of enrolled courses** (prominently displayed)
   - Complete list of enrolled courses
   - Export option

The implementation successfully fulfills the requirement to represent data in cards with a "View More Details" feature that displays how many courses a user has enrolled in through a Material Dialog.
